    <p>Have you ever thought, how it would feel like, being outside. <em>yes outside!!!</em>. Those were the thoughts running through 5 years old Emeka. Emeka always wondered what it felt like being outside. He always said to himself, there's got to be more outside of this round, spherical thingy we're in.</p>
    <p>What really sparked his interest at such a tender age was his Basic science teacher, who always mesmerized them with this unsettling puzzle of the solar system, which always left them in awe. One of Emeka's favorite parts of the class was the part where they had to recite the planets in the solar system. He loved it. He always sang it, on his way back home....</p>
   <em>
    <p>I know the planets, how about you?</p>
    <p>I know the planets, how about you?</p>
    <p>I know the planets, how about you?</p>
    <p>Let's say the name together!</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Mercury, Venus</li>
    <li>Earth and Mars</li>
    <li>Jupiter and Saturn among the stars</li>
    <li>Uranus, Neptune are up there too</li>
    <li>All spin around in space it's true!!</li>
   </ul>

    <p>At this time, Emeka wanted to know more but he was limited to just what his teacher gave him, so he grew up knowing just that. Fast-forward to 10 years later, Emeka now possesses a cellular device that processes information at the touch of his fingers. <em><b>The more you look, the less you see </em></b>, that was what could be described as Emeka's situation. The more he researched, listened, watched everything relating to this seemingly wonderful Eledumare's Masterpiece, the more he became perplexed, muddled and muzzed.</p>
    <p>Still unsatisfied, he was lost in his thoughts, again, he was asking himself...</p>
    <p>What's holding the earth, how does it turn round the sun on it's own, are we really a speck, how..., this and a million more questions gave Emeka chills down his spine, the more he thought about it, the more his heart raced at the thought of being outside. Words might fail Emeka in his journey to uncovering this mystery, but one thing is for certain, that amongst the <e> million and one things</e> that amazes him about Eledumare's creations, he will forever be humbled by this <b>Eledumare's Masterpiece.</b></p>
